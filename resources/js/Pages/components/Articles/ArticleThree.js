          A development and international relations analyst,
          Professor Lord Mawuko-Yevugah has called for a
          review of the country’s political and public
          incentive system to save the nation from its
          economic challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          He suggested that like any other ordinary worker who take
          loans to build their own houses and buy cars, politicians
          and institutional heads with these fringe benefits should
          be made to take loans to buy those luxuries themselves and
          not be depending on the state to provide
          them these incentives aside their “fat salaries”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Mawuko-Yevugah, who delivered a lecture dubbed,
          "COVID-19 Pandemic, Russia-Ukraine War and Ghana’s Economic
          Crisis," at the Ghana Institute of Management Administration
          (GIMPA) last Thursday in Accra, questioned the justification
          of politicians and chief executive officers of parastatals
          being given free accommodations, cars and other
          incentives they could afford from their salaries.
        </p>
        <p>Drain on economy</p>
        <p>
          This was a major drain on the economy, he noted, calling
          for something to be
          done to change the status quo of providing such incentives.
          “We agree with President Akufo-Addo when he said recently, that ‘the international financial structure is skewed significantly against developing and emerging economies like Ghana’.

          But while we support his call for reform of the global
          governance architecture, we strongly believe that it is about
          time Ghana and other African countries took the bull by the horn
          by taking their destinies into their own hands”, he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Mawuko-Yevugah said the country needed cost saving
          measures including removal of perks and other burdens on
          the public
          purse to keep expenditures in check and save money to fund
          development infrastructure.

          He noted that major socio-economic interventions
          that would support the economic conditions of Ghanaians
          were not being
          attended to due to lack of resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Mawuko-Yevugah noted that the time had come for the
          government to do something drastic about the bloated
          government size and save the country from the economic
          hardship emanating from the COVID- 19 pandemic and
          Russia-Ukraine war.

          Observing that the sense of governing in the country has become
          huge,
          Prof. Mawuko-Yevugah questioned “Why parastatals such as the
          Forestry Commission, Aviation, National Lottery should have
          CEOs and two Deputy CEOs when they belong to a ministry already
          and that ministry has a minister and two deputies?”

          The country, he said, could be liberated from these excesses
          if there were expenditure controls including stringent public
          financial management system.
        </p>
        <p>
        Complete overhauling
        </p>
        <p>
        The impacts of the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine War, he said had exposed the weak foundations of fragile economies and their vulnerabilities to the vicissitudes of the global economy.

The Ghanaian economy crisis, he said, had manifested in rising inflation, rising budget deficits, ballooning and unsustainable debts levels, precipitous depreciation and fall in the value of the local currency (the cedi) relative to the major foreign currencies.

The lecture was organised by Think Progress Ghana in collaboration with the Graduate Students' Association of Ghana and GIMPA.
