                       In this wide-ranging collection of essays, Mawuko-Yevugah explores the challenges of 
                       political reform and democratic governance in Africa at the beginning of the 21st Century,
                       focusing largely on Ghana's experience. The inspiration for the title of the collection, 
                       AFRICAN TIME, comes from Kwame Nkrumah's pan-African optimism as well as from recent 
                       discourses around "African Renaissance" "Africa's Century" "Africa Rising" etc. 
                       At Ghana's founding in 1957, Nkrumah proclaimed: 'Our independence is meaningless unless 
                       it is linked up to the total liberation of the African continent. Today, from now on, 
                       there is a new African in the world . . . That new African is ready to fight his own 
                       battles and show that after all, the black man is capable of managing his own affairs' 
                       That historic declaration, Mawuko-Yevugah argues, did not only set the tone and direction 
                       for Ghana's pan-African foreign policy but it has also made the country a reference point 
                       for Africa's postcolonial tragedy in the form of political instability and economic decay. 
                       Exploring Ghana's recent strides in democratic consolidation within the context of fresh 
                       attempts to reinvent pan-Africanism and mainstream good governance on the continental 
                       development agenda, this book offers incisive, 
                       critical and a rare reflection on the changing landscape of contemporary African politics 
                       and governance through the eyes of a political journalist.
