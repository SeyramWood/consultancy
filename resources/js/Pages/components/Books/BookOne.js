                       Made in Ghana is a collection of essays on wide-ranging issues highlighting the challenges of democratic governance and socio-economic transformation in Ghana and Africa broadly, and within the context of changing power dynamics at the global level and the implications of these changes for the liberal political and economic architecture both locally and globally. The title is deliberately chosen to reflect Ghana’s historical role as the epic-center of Africa’s historical articulation with the capitalist and neoliberal global economy. In particular, the book focuses on the political economy of governance in Ghana, analyzing the challenges of democratic consolidation and the interplay of forces shaping the country’s quest at achieving economic transformation within the country’s current democratic dispensation. More importantly, the book provides a critical analysis on contemporary Africa’s developmental quagmire within the context of the broader global political economy, focusing on the crisis of American-led western capitalism and neoliberalism and the prospects and promises of a new global order.
