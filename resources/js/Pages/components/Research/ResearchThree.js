                Contrary to the expectations of several theorists belonging to the
                modernisation school, chieftaincy as a traditional institution survived
                various political changes throughout the 19th and 20th century in most
                African states. Nonetheless, their existence thereafter has varied in
                these states. Some states have lauded, recognised and employed chiefs
                for state development, while other states have blatantly ignored and
                designated the offices of chiefs as an obsolete governance institution
                that has outlived their usefulness.

                The variance in the disposition to chiefs is identified as deeply
                rooted in a long-standing debate over the relationship between
                modernity and tradition. This study explores this debate, adopting the
                Ghanaian chieftaincy institution in its modern form as a case study. A
                synthesis of existing literature on the relevant concepts was developed
                and discussed in the development of the study. The study identified the
                major debate on tradition and modernity to be situated in a binary school,
                where one strand believes they can both exist together, and the other
                situates their argument in the need to abolish tradition completely
                from modern societies. For the Ghanaian setting, however, the chieftaincy
                institution is recognised and accorded its autonomy in the 1992
                Constitution of Ghana.
