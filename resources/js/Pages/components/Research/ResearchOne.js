                By the mid-to-late 1980s, barely two decades after decolonization on
                much of the African continent, a new process of economic policy reform became a defining
                characteristic across the African continent mainly in response to the
                “crisis of development.” What was the nature of policies implemented
                across the continent during the period of reform? What were the interplay
                of factors and actors driving these reforms? What have been the
                implications of the implementation of economic reform policies for
                the continent’s postcolonial developmental and transformative agenda?

                This conceptual chapter explores how an interplay of domestic and
                international political and economic processes and actors have
                influenced and shaped Africa’s postcolonial developmental vision
                through the implementation of specific sets of policy reforms.
                In doing so, and in order to provide an intellectual context for some
                of the discussions raised in the book, this chapter provides a broad
                overview of competing theoretical approaches to policy reform
                historically, showing how the current neoliberal policy agenda became a
                hegemonic construct in Africa’s postcolonies from the 1980s. It also
                specifies Ghana’s experiences as political actors and factors in this
                West African state impact its evolving economic policy.
